#User Story

##When I load the webpage
Then I see a clean user interface with a hero image from NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day

##When I click on the input form under the hero image
Then a calendar drops down with which I can choose a picture from previous APODs

##When I click submit
Then I see the APOD from that day and a button generates from local storage for easy future reference

##When I scroll down
Then I see an array of cards with links to other pages, each containing space-related information

##When I click on one of those cards
Then the corresponding webpage loads with the information pertaining to the category of card selected
